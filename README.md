# Course-Registeration-and-Time-Table-Generation
The MIS Portal for course registration and time table generation is a web application designed for the students and staff of a college. The portal was built using HTML, CSS, Node.js, and MongoDB, and was created with the goal of providing a centralized platform for all college-related information and processes. The portal's course registration system allowed students to easily enroll in courses, view their schedules, and receive real-time updates on course availability. The time table generation system was also integrated into the portal, allowing the college to automatically generate schedules based on the courses selected by students. Node.js was used as the backend framework for the application, providing a fast and reliable platform for handling the large amounts of data required for course registration and time table generation. MongoDB was used as the database, allowing for quick and easy storage and retrieval of student and course information.
